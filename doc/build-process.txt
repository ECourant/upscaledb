    Build Process

------------------

    This document describes the software configuration management, build 
targets etc.

------------------

    hamster-db uses "scons" as a "make" replacement.

    The library is built as a static library and a shared library.

    Build files (.o/.obj) are stored in a separate directory ("./build")

    Specialized builds for debugging, profiling and a release build are
supported

    Documentation generation is also generated as part of the build process.
The generated documentation files are compiled into the "./doc"-directory.

    Scons is also used as an autoconf-replacement. No further tools should
be required for the build process.
