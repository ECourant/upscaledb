May 10, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.2

May 10, 2007 - chris
o refactored the freelist and reimplemented it as a bitmap
o removed HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE - this flag is no longer needed, the new bitmap
    structures are automatically optimized

May 5, 2007 - chris
o new unittests for the freelist

Apr 04, 2007 - chris
o refactored the cache and some other modules
o bugfix in ham_open_ex: the cachesize parameter was ignored; ham_open_ex
    always used HAM_DEFAULT_CACHESIZE

Apr 02, 2007 - chris
o started writing unittests and refactoring

Mar 27, 2007 - chris
o database files are now endian-agnostic; hamsterdb can now use big-endian 
    databases on little-endian architectures and vice versa 

Mar 21, 2007 - chris
o removed HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY - i'll replace it with file locking in a 
    few weeks
o use mmap if the db-pagesize is a multiple of the os-pagesize, and not 
    just if it's equal
o do not store the following flags in the database: HAM_DISABLE_VAR_KEYLEN,
    HAM_CACHE_STRICT, HAM_DISABLE_MMAP, HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY, 
    HAM_WRITE_THROUGH, HAM_READ_ONLY, HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE, 
    HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH
o fixed an unlikely crash in ham_cursor_move: if the cursor was nil after 
    moving the cursor, return an error

Mar 17, 2007 - chris
o added configure-option --enable-internal to enable all internal 
    functions (ham_dump and ham_check_integrity). disabling those functions
    shrinks the library size by a few kilobytes
o improved the documentation in the header-files

Mar 16, 2007 - chris
o improved configure.in - added --enable-shrink, removed optimizations 
    for --enable-debug, all other modes will now use -O3

Mar 06, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.1

Mar 04, 2007
o moved the ./tests-subdirectory to a separate repository

Mar 03, 2007
o win32 compiles and links as a static or dynamic library with Visual C++ 
    2005 Express Edition; testes are all successful

Feb 11, 2007
o many small changes to compile everything on cygwin

Feb 04, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.0

Feb 03, 2007 - chris
o all write-functions return an error if they're called but the 
    database is in read-only mode
o added a new sample db3.c, which reads words from stdin and prints them 
    in sorted order
o removed the flag HAM_OPEN_CREATE; it was broken anyway

Feb 02, 2007 - chris
o database cursors are now fully implemented and tested

Jan 24, 2007 - chris
o default behaviour for ham_create changed; already existing files are now
    overwritten
o now uses -Wall on platforms with gcc
o resized the default cache size from 128kb to 256kb

Jan 23, 2007 - chris
o added a new sample db2.c, which copies an existing database to another
    database using a cursor.

Jan 21, 2007 - chris
o the cursor implementation is finished and seems to work; testing is not 
    yet complete. 
o ham_flush now has an (unused) flags-parameter.
o renamed samples/simple.c to samples/db1.c

Jan 20, 2007 - chris
o created one global transaction-pointer in the database object, and 
    removed all transaction parameters for most functions; added tests that 
    only one single transaction object is created.

Dec 23, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3.1

Dec 23, 2006 - chris
o header-files are now installed to $prefix/include/ham
o test is not build if db.h is missing

Dec 19, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3

Dec 15, 2006 - chris
o started the port to MS Windows; so far, there are only two batch
    files to create the library, but no nmake file or Visual Studio 
    project.
o started to move the stuff to automake/autoconf; transition is not
    yet complete

Dec 10, 2006 - chris 
o a new parameter HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE creates smaller files by merging 
    freelist entries (comes at a small performance penalty)

Nov 26, 2006 - chris 
o extended keys are now cached (if the cache size is big enough) 

Nov 24, 2006 - chris 
o added HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH - when a freelist page is modified, it 
    is no longer flushed immediately. this is dangerous - in case of a 
    crash, the database is most likely broken.

Nov 23, 2006 - chris 
o fixed a small leak - if records are overwritten, and the new record size
    is smaller then sizeof(ham_offset_t), the old blob was not added to 
    the freelist

Nov 22, 2006 - chris 
o completely rewrote the freelist - elements are now sorted, and access is 
    a lot faster. also, elements are merged, if possible, which 
    results in smaller files
o fixed a bug; if the root page is split, the address of the root page
    was not stored correctly in the database header

Nov 12, 2006 - chris 
o completely rewrote the blob storage - blobs are now stored in one big 
    chunk, and not splitted into pages
o replaced read/write with pread/pwrite
o fixed a small bug related to a performance improvement on Nov 5th
    (removed too many memset's...)

Nov 09, 2006 - chris 
o fetching in-memory-blobs created a memory leak if the record data 
    was allocated by the user

Nov 07, 2006 - chris 
o blobs which were overwritten (and therefore were deleted) were not 
    added to the freelist

Nov 05, 2006 - chris 
o fixed a tiny memory leak in blob_erase
o replaced linear search in btree_get_slot and btree_insert with 
    binary search, got significant performance improvements
o removed some unnecessary memsets, after allocating a new page
o relaxed the "minkey"-rule: after erasing, pages are now merged when 
    there are <=4 elements in the page

Nov 04, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.1pre2

Oct 26, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - the return value was ignored, when 
    allocating a new page. if the cache was too small, NULL was returned
    and the library crashed

Oct 24, 2006 - chris
o fixed minor issues for compiling on 32bit machines

Oct 18, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - too many freelist pages were allocated
o fixed a bug: when allocating pages, and the page was removed from the
    freelist, and the page type was not set correctly

Oct 12, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in blob_allocate when allocating big blobs
o fixed a bug when overwriting keys, and the blob was empty, tiny or 
    small (<=sizeof(ham_offset_t))

Oct 8, 2006 - chris
o completely rewrote the test environment (./dbtest.py)

Oct 3, 2006 - chris
o rewrote the SConscript and all scons-files
o added the Doxyfile (Doxygen build script) to generate the documentation

Sep 22, 2006 - chris
o added the README-file
o enabled support for O_LARGEFILE

Sep 21, 2006 - chris
o renamed COPYING to LICENSE; also renamed the header comments in all files
