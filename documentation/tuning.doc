/*! \page tuning Performance Tuning The Hamster

and here's all about those HINT flags and their order of precedence when it comes to env and db-wide DAM modes and and and ...

/subsection The Gains, The Spoils

a few performance metrics comparing a few use cases and what happens with and without certain flags, maybe?



/subsection The Unfortunate Consequences

I'm a 'risk analysis' guy part of the time and my mindset is focussed on 
'what can go wrong' almost all the time, so this is the perfect place for
a sermon on The Dire Consequences: databases growing faster than you might 
want; performance loss in the long term when you keep on doing it like
that and then change usage scenario where traveling up a rubenesque database
isn't suddenly all that much fun any more... yada yada
