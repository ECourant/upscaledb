x release 0.4.4!

x update samples and tutorial on hamsterdb.com

x add grammar fixes for the tutorial

x replace return code INVALID_INDEX with NOT_INITIALIZED

x replace return code ENV_FULL with a generic HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

x unittest: fill an environment, till it returns HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

x new unittest: ham_new, create, ham_close, open, ham_close, ham_delete
    x for db
    x for env
    x for db in env

x new unittest: insert extended keys with 0xffff byte size, search for it

x new unittest: create with READ_ONLY -> fail INVALID_PARAMETER

o db1.c: 
    x should reopen the database file (then we have a call to ham_open,
        which is otherwise not tested on CE)
    x crashes!!
    o then test on CE

o new unittest: 
    o set compare function
    o unset compare function
    o set compare function AFTER db_open -> failure

    o set prefix-compare function
    o unset prefix-compare function
    o set prefix-compare function AFTER db_open -> failure

o new unittest: open with READ_ONLY; all write-functions must fail

o new unittest: open env with READ_ONLY; all write-functions must fail, 
        and write-functions of opened databases must fail, too

o new unittest: create an environment, don't insert a database; close, reopen
    o then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should fail with HAM_DATABASE_NOT_FOUND (document this!)

o new unittest: create an environment, insert two databases, delete the first
    o then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should load the first available database

o new unittests for exclusive file locking (but how?)

o more tests and performance checks with very large files - around 10 GB

o should backends have a version information? otherwise, the 32byte might be
    full, and we don't have room for an overflow area...

? freelist: keep lookaside-list of freelist pages (which freelist
    page starts at address xxxx?) to speed up the whole process

o add support for logical record numbers
