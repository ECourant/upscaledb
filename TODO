x release 0.4.4!

x update samples and tutorial on hamsterdb.com

o add grammar fixes for the tutorial

o replace return code INVALID_INDEX with NOT_INITIALIZED

o replace return code ENV_FULL with a generic HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

o db1.c: should reopen the database file (then we have a call to ham_open,
    which is otherwise not tested on CE)
    o then test on CE

o new unittest: 
    o set compare function
    o unset compare function
    o set compare function AFTER db_open -> failure

o new unittest: insert extended keys with 0xffff byte size, search for it

o new unittest: create an environment, don't insert a database; close, reopen
    o then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should fail with HAM_DATABASE_NOT_FOUND (document this!)

o new unittest: create an environment, insert two databases, delete the first
    o then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should load the first available database

o new unittests for exclusive file locking (but how?)

o more tests and performance checks with very large files - around 10 GB

o add support for logical record numbers

o should backends have a version information? otherwise, the 32byte might be
    full, and we don't have room for an overflow area...

? freelist: keep lookaside-list of freelist pages (which freelist
    page starts at address xxxx?) to speed up the whole process
