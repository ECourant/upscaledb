x compare performance of default-keysize with keysize=8 or
    keysize=default_keysize+1 - no differences

x check monster.sh: --cachepolicy=strict (with default cachesize) should
    lead to errors, but doesn't - it's ok

x replace os_tell with os_get_filesize 
    x unit tests!

x old cppunits are recognized, but don't compile 
    (cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h does not exist) - fix the test in 
    configure.in

x win32 monster.sh: does not [FAIL] if test throws an assertion
    (test with ./test --inmemorydb=1 --reopen=1 or sth similar)

x unit-tests for cursor.c (as described in tdd.txt)

x unit-tests for util.c (as described in tdd.txt)

x fix doxygen tags (see mail)

x fix a small memory leak
    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes ./test --file ../../testfiles/2/ext_060.tst --inmemorydb=1

x logo!!

x create a webpage
    x contents are missing
        x sidebars
        x faq
    x tutorial
        x also add docs about installation, compilation, porting
        x download as pdf
        x don't forget to add it to Makefile.am/EXTRA_DIST
    x news
        x sidebar!
    x move to a subversion repository!
    x gpl2: sidebar is messed up (esp. in fullscreen mode)
    x ask someone to correct my english
    x front-picture
        x change the text
        x insert the logo (?)
    x doxygen-documentation is broken
    x review the "impressum"
    x need meta-tags

x configure.in/Makefile.am: should not build cppunit if it's not 
    installed (HAVE_CPPUNIT is ignored!)

x port to big-endian

x port to the SUN Sparc architecture (different from other big-endian
    archs, because of alignment issues)
