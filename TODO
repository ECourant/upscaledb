x improve unittests

x erlang does not build because ./configure overwrites CFLAGS

o new API for bulk operations

o cleanup transactions
    x hide refcount in base class ("ReferenceCounted")
    x use intrusive_list.h for transactions in TxnManager
    o use std::multimap instead of rb.h
        - The map's key is the key of the TxnNode, the values are the operations
        - The TxnNode class is then no longer required; callers use iterators
            instead
        - use RAII for all stored elements, then cleaning up is much simpler
    o create transactions on the stack
    o use template parameters for std::multimap
    o get rid of the changeset (see trello comments)

o cleanup cursor code
    x clean up the public interface
    o BtreeCursor and TxnCursor should have similar interfaces
    o there should be 3 states:
        - nil
        - coupled to btree
        - coupled to txn
        o state() - returns the state
        o set_state() - changes the state
    o key() returns the current key
    o record() returns the current record
    o get rid of the DuplicateCache and the duplicate index in the cursor; if
        the DeltaUpdates are correctly sorted, then the cursor should not be
        necessary (unless the duplicate position is explicitly required via
        ups_cursor_get_duplicate_position())
        -- this is an old comment. Is it still true? At least make sure that
            the cache is only updated when absolutely necessary!

o improve MaskedVbyte
    o extend libvbyte for 64bit (but only use 1 byte for flags!)
    o when using 32bit: fallback to MaskedVbyte if possible
    o make sure to use the newest version of MaskedVbyte
    o promote the library

o uint32 record compression

o new test case for cursors
    insert (1, a)
    insert (1, b) (duplicate of 1)
    move (last) (-> 1, b)
    insert (1, c)
    move (last) (-> 1, c)? is the dupecache updated correctly?

o there are a couple of areas where a btree cursor is uncoupled, just to
    retrieve the key and to couple the txn-key. that's not efficient
        db.c:__btree_cursor_points_to
        db.c:__compare_cursors
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_sync
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_overwrite
    o move to a separate function
    o try to optimize


. add built-in predicate "greater", "greater-than", "lower",
    "lower-than", "equals"?
    -> how to pass the parameters?
    -> not as plugin but as built-in operators? - no...
    o make sure that they are not used as a function
    o only for numeric data

. add built-in predicate "starts-with" for strings/binary data
. add built-in predicate "like" for regex on strings/binary data


------------------- idea soup ---------------------------------------------

- compilation for ARM:
    sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
    ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --disable-simd --enable-debug

o remove dependency to libuv 1.0, use boost::async instead (makes the build
    process a lot smoother)

o add tests to verify that the cursor is not modified if an operation fails!
    (in cursor.cpp:LongTxnCursorTest are some wrapper functions to move or
    insert the cursor; that's a good starting point)


o More things to refactor in the btree
    o EraseAction uses duplicate_index + 1, InsertAction uses duplicate_index
        -> use a common behaviour/indexing
    o EraseAction line 71: if the node is empty then it should be merged and
        moved to the freelist!

o when splitting and HAM_HINT_APPEND is set, the new page is appended.
    do the same for prepend!

o The PageManager state is currently stored in a compressed encoding, but
    it is less efficient than the standard varbyte encoding because
    pages > 15 * page_size have to be split. Use a standard vbyte encoding
    instead (it will anyway be required later on).

o Implement record compression - a few notes
    ByteSlice: Pushing the Envelop of Main Memory Data
    Processing with a New Storage Layout
    http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2750000/2747642/p31-feng.pdf

    1) the user defines the record structure.
    2) an optimization stage reorders the record columns to optimize storage
        (i.e. with dynamic programming)
    3) SIMD code is generated on the fly to pack, unpack records and single
        elements (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911993/how-to-generate-and-run-native-code-dynamically or ask Ben/Andi...)
    4) Pack like PAX (group all column values together) or each record
        standalone?

o look for a better compression for DefaultRecordList, i.e.
    - Each group is a GroupedVarInt w/ 4 bits per entry; a 64bit
        number can then hold flags for 16 numbers
        -> (but maybe increase this to hold at least 32 or 64 numbers, to
            reduce the overhead ratio)
    o create a GroupedVarInt<Max, T> class, where |Max| is the maximum number
        of elements that are grouped, and T is the type of these elements
        (i.e. uint64_t)
        -> memory is managed by the caller
        -> the state (i.e. used block size etc) is stored externally, and
            managed by the caller
        o append a key
        o prepend a key
        o insert a key in the middle
        o grow blocks
        o split blocks
        o can perform copies w/o re-compressing

    o try to move the Zint32 index to a base class
    o Use small index which stores offset + bits for each group
    o a separate bit is used to signal whether the (compressed) number is
        a record id
    o avoid ripple effects by growing/splitting the block

o use compression also for duplicate records
    i.e. use GroupedVarint for inline duplicates

o Concurrency: merge BtreeUpdates in the background

o when recovering, give users the choice if active transactions should be
    aborted (default behavior) or re-created
    o needs a function to enumerate them

o A new transactional mode: read-only transactions can run "in the past" - only
    on committed transactions. therefore they avoid conflicts and will always
    succeed.

o need a function to get the txn of a conflict (same as in v2)
    ups_status_t ups_txn_get_conflicting_txn(ups_txn_t *txn, ups_txn_t **other);
        oder: txn-id zur√ºckgeben? sonst gibt's ne race condition wenn ein anderer
        thread "other" committed/aborted
    o also add to c++ API
    o add documentation (header file)
    o add documentation (wiki)
