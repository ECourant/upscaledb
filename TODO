o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x release 0.4.8 

x update webpage
    x C++ API: add documentation to webpage
    x add FAQ entry about security (AES related)
    x add FAQ why C++ cursor is not stl-compatible

x be more careful when uncoupling cursors - especially when inserting 
    or deleting items, uncoupling is often not necessary
    x definitely no need to uncouple if overwriting or adding a duplicate
    x often no need to uncouple when inserting/splitting
    x unittests: 
        x create cursor -> must be NIL
        x insert item   -> must be NIL
        x move cursor to item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert item2 < item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert duplicate of item -> cursor is still coupled
        x insert item2 > item -> cursor is uncoupled

o enhance acceptance tests
    x acceptance test: encryption is missing
    o new acceptance tests with many, many duplicates
    o --duplicate-position="before"|"after"|"first"|"last"(default)
        o add to monster.sh
        o add to valgrind.sh

. compression: store the size of the uncompressed data as the first 4 byte
    in the blob; then uncompression is easier and faster

o run extensive tests on sparc architecture

o remove TODOs in the source

o do benchmarking with 1 mio inserts/reads

o do benchmarking on windows, esp. with and without mmap

o win64: debug builds fail in mmap routines
    -> workaround: link against release libraries??

o tests are failing:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1 -- berkeley bug
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch

o create a new repository for hamsterdb-alien for all dependencies 
    in source and precompiled (static/non-debug - cppunit and berkeleydb)
    x linux64-le
    x linux32-le
    x win32
    o cygwin32
    o win64
    o wince-x86
    o ppc32-be

o command line tool ham_info
o command line tool ham_dump
o command line tool ham_recovery

o release 0.4.9

. do a complete source code review, or ask someone to do it;
    make sure that the test coverage is as high as possible

. webpage
    o move to cakephp framework
    o frontpage: resize hamster picture; remove text -> more space below
        (for 3 colums: news, main features, articles/testimonials/link cloud)
    o rss feed

. C++ cursors are no stl iterators
    -> need ++ and -- (prefix only)
    -> rend and rbegin
    -> end: is not the last element, but a symbolic "end"-element
    -> begin: if it fails, must return end()
    -> operator*: returns std::pair<key, record>
    -> operator->: i->first(), i->second()
    -> operator== and operator!=, operator= and copy-constructor
