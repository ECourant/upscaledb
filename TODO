o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x release 0.4.8 

x update webpage
    x C++ API: add documentation to webpage
    x add FAQ entry about security (AES related)
    x add FAQ why C++ cursor is not stl-compatible

x be more careful when uncoupling cursors - especially when inserting 
    or deleting items, uncoupling is often not necessary
    x definitely no need to uncouple if overwriting or adding a duplicate
    x often no need to uncouple when inserting/splitting
    x unittests: 
        x create cursor -> must be NIL
        x insert item   -> must be NIL
        x move cursor to item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert item2 < item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert duplicate of item -> cursor is still coupled
        x insert item2 > item -> cursor is uncoupled

x enhance acceptance tests
    x acceptance test: encryption is missing
    x new acceptance tests with many, many duplicates

x make sure we fail to open databases which have incompatible versions

x compression: store the size of the uncompressed data as the first 4 byte
    in the blob; then uncompression is easier and faster
    x unittest w/ HAM_RECORD_USER_ALLOC

x remove TODOs in the source

x command line tool ham_info
    usage: ham_info [-db dbname] [-f] filename
        -db: prints only stats about this database
        -f: (--full) - number of items, average key size, average data
            size, min/max sizes, number of extended keys
    x create autotools infrastructure
    x list environment information
    x list database information
    x list full database information
    x create automated tests
    x create msvc projects

x command line tool ham_dump: dumps keys and records
    usage: ham_dump [-key format] [-record format] 
                [-maxkey n] [-maxrec n] [-db dbname] filename
    x create autotools infrastructure
    x create msvc projects
    x dump key/record: numeric|string|binary
    x create automated tests
 
x command line tools must be installed; currently, automake does not
    install them

x check roadmap.txt for other TODO items

x do benchmarking with 1 mio inserts/reads

o do benchmarking on windows, esp. with and without mmap

o win64: debug builds fail in mmap routines
    -> workaround: link against release libraries??

o autoconf: check if flock, LOCK_EX etc exist and make sure we don't
    x add /usr/ucbinclude to solaris include path
    o test it!

o improve unit-test coverage

o run extensive tests on sparc architecture
    x unittests
    o acceptance tests
    o bi-directional endian-check!

o release 0.4.9

. tests are failing because of a berkeleydb bug:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch

. create a new repository for hamsterdb-alien for all dependencies 
    in source and precompiled (static/non-debug - cppunit and berkeleydb)
    x linux64-le
    x linux32-le
    x win32
    o cygwin32
    o win64
    o wince-x86
    o ppc32-be
    o sparc-32
