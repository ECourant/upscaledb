o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o make environment pointer obligatory - ham_create[_ex] and ham_open[_ex]
    create a private environment handle if it was not supplied
    o don't forget to close/delete the handle!
    o clean up db.h/db.c code
    o move code from ham_create[_ex] into ham_env_create_db?
    o move code from ham_open[_ex] into ham_env_open_db?
    o move code from ham_close into ham_env_close?

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

o sort duplicate keys - Ger has patches

o ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. re-enable HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT
    o acceptance tests fail, i.e. ./test --keysize=680 --duplicate=1 
        -dam HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT ../../testfiles/1/190.tst (and others)
    o re-enable tests in monster.sh

. Ger sent new statistics.c with minor fixes - it's on crupp.de:~
    o merge - but doesn't work yet! Wait for new fixes...
    x be careful - i think it's already merged... - no it isn't!
    o run monster.sh

. reorg. the HINT flags - they're now in hamsterdb_int.h and still used
    internally -> have them completely replaced by the DAM?

. approx. matching: need a sample

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

----------

. enhance java/python/.NET for transactions and approx matching
    o update README file(s) with new address
    o python: we now have a ham_get_key_count() function and do not need the
        slow iteration code anymore

. enhance acceptance tests - will need new test scripts
    TXN_BEGIN 1  (1 is the txn id)
    TXN_ABORT 1
    TXN_INSERT 1 ...
    TXN_ERASE 1 ...
    TXN_COMMIT 1

. release-process: enhance automated tests of win32/win64 dll and lib

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. tests are failing because of a berkeleydb bug:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch
