x release 0.4.4!

x update samples and tutorial on hamsterdb.com

x add grammar fixes for the tutorial

x replace return code INVALID_INDEX with NOT_INITIALIZED

x replace return code ENV_FULL with a generic HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

x unittest: fill an environment, till it returns HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

x new unittest: ham_new, create, ham_close, open, ham_close, ham_delete
    x for db
    x for env
    x for db in env

x new unittest: insert extended keys with 0xffff byte size, search for it

x new unittest: create with READ_ONLY -> fail INVALID_PARAMETER

x new unittest: 
    x set compare function
    x unset compare function
    x set prefix-compare function
    x unset prefix-compare function

x db1.c: 
    x should reopen the database file (then we have a call to ham_open,
        which is otherwise not tested on CE)
    x crashes!!
    x then test on CE

x new unittest: open with READ_ONLY; all write-functions must fail

x new unittest: open env with READ_ONLY; all write-functions must fail, 
        and write-functions of opened databases must fail, too

x new unittest: create file with pagesize 64kb, then open it

x new unittest: create env with pagesize 64kb, then open it

x new unittest: select a pagesize/keysize so less than 4 keys fit on a 
    page -> INV_KEYSIZE

x new unittest: create an environment, don't insert a database; close
    then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)

x new unittest: create an environment, insert a database; close
    then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should load the first available database

x new unittest: create an environment, insert two databases, delete the first
    then open the environment as a database file (ham_open)
        - should load the first available database

o new unittests for exclusive file locking
    x check on linux
    x check on windows
    o check on cygwin -- fails!



o all unittests should run on Windows CE

o more tests and performance checks with very large files - around 10 GB

o should backends have a version information? otherwise, the 32byte might be
    full, and we don't have room for an overflow area...

? freelist: keep lookaside-list of freelist pages (which freelist
    page starts at address xxxx?) to speed up the whole process

o add support for logical record numbers
    o new call "u64_t ham_get_count(db)" (can also be used to get the last
        lrn)
    o stored at little-endian, but returned to the caller in host-endian
