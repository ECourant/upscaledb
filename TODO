 
I Am Legend:

Items are sorted by priority (highest on top).
o a pending  TODO item (for the current release)
. a pending  TODO item (for future releases)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x hamsterdb.com: add permanent redirect from hamsterdb.com to 
	www.hamsterdb.com (and all other domains!)

x do not build mongoose if remote is diabled

x some cleanup:
    x db_set_allocdata -> for records, but we need a similar function for keys!
        currently, db_set_key_allocdata() is used, but it's very clumsy
    x check_create_parameters -> move to env.c?? - no, also needed in
        hamsterdb.c
    x my_free_cb is duplicated in env.c und hamsterdb.c!
    x make sure there are no more warnings

x server: 
    x shutdown time is very long (10 sec)
    x mongoose - disable default handler (returns file listing!)
    x add mongoose license to readme!
    x make sure connections are not closed immediately (keep-alive)
        -> done automatically (10 seconds)

x move to github server!!
    x upload/import code
    x update release.sh scripts
    x update ohloh enlistments
    x update hamsterdb.com/download/subversion URL and page
    x svnserve: disable read for anonymous access, disable write for 
            ssh-access
    x write a blog comment
    x add to ChangeLog!

x need a client1.c sample (which works with server1.c)

x more unittests
    x test with big blobs!
    x unittest: negative insert, negative find, negative erase
    x unittest: ham_env_create_db w/ extended params
    x unittest for approx matching

x libhamserver.a should have its own libtool version! - already has!

x improve documentation
    x hamserver.h - add doxygen section etc
    x extend the tutorial

x call curl_global_cleanup() (take care - eventually not threadsafe?!)
    x finally get rid of ALL the memory leaks for remote stuff

x unix daemon
    x -h for help
    x -f for foreground
    x shutdown by sending sigterm
    x -c for config file
    x -p for pidfile
    x fail if no config file was specified
    x configuration file: no default path; is set by command line parameter
            (on windows we need a default path!)
        x use to specify the port
        x use to specify available databases/Environments and their url
        x use to specify the logging (Yes, no and where to?)
    x initialize the server
    x create new environments and databases (if requested)
    x on shutdown: close all environments, close the server
    x make sure that all relevant signals are caught
    x rename json.h/c -> config.h/c
    x also rename functions and structures
    x "-c config -f" does not run in foreground - getopts-bug
    x logging: will need enhancements in hamserver
        x access log: mongoose OPT_ACCESS_LOG
        x error log: mongoose OPT_ERROR_LOG
    x on shutdown: what if transactions and cursors are open?

x improve documentation in hamsterdb.h
    x ham_insert: does not list HAM_HINT_APPEND/PREPEND - not true!
    x move all comments from ham_*_open to ham_*_open_ex
    x move all comments from ham_*_create to ham_*_create_ex etc
    x ham_txn_begin: has no comments, just parameters
    x ham_open_ex: dito
    x ham_create_ex: dito
    x ham_open, ham_create, ham_env_open, ham_env_create: should be 
            deprecated??? - no, but will be removed with 2.0

. more server stuff
    o add acceptance tests
    . install a callback for authentication (and offer a predefined
        callback for SSL?)
    . support https?

. disable local client?
    o need configure switch to disable the local client
        -> also clean up db.h, env.h...
    o add tests for --disable-remote and --disable-local to release.sh

o test the following:
        db=ham_create()
        env=ham_get_env(db)
        ham_env_close(env) ???

o webpage changes
    o add client1.c/server1.c to hamsterdb.com/documentation/samples

o utilize the github wiki
    o move the FAQ
    o move the tutorial

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o release new .NET wrapper with fix from a.todorov (-> nabble)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================================

o update the Python API 

. pure java network client

o update win32 files to 2008

. WinCE: create and run Unittests project
    http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/02/23/78930.aspx
    o also, we could use mmap (which is currently disabled)

. some tests in filter.cpp are deactivated - fix them

. run profiling for duplicate tests - can things be improved?
    o blob_overwrite/duplicate table handling: in some cases we can use
        HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS to speed up things (at least for in-memory)

. webpage changes
    http://www.purenetworks.com/
    http://www.omegathemes.com/tf/smartages/#
    http://eucalyptus.com/
    x the header page image is too large
    o frontpage: have multiple images (scrolling in background) with more
        text info? 
        http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/basic.html
        http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/image-slider/
        http://www.slidedeck.com/
    o sitemap: pulldown with jquery
    o download: need download gates to track in analytics as goals
    o rss feed

. improve documentation/tutorial/faq about
    o confluence is too slow on this server :( Need something else...
    o move some of the documentation and tutorial to a Wiki
        o tutorial (remove from doxygen)
        o samples (remove from doxygen)
        o faq (remove from doxygen)
        o internal developer documentation (remove from doxygen)
    o tutorial/faq: add hinting flags
    o tutorial/faq: add DAMs

. add automatic code coverage using gconv
    http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/gcov/
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html
    http://aleccolocco.blogspot.com/2009/08/sqlite-lesson-in-low-defect-software.html (section "Test Coverage with GCC")
    o track coverage results, publish online
    o gui tools: http://code.google.com/p/trucov/,
                 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggcov/files/ 

. remove HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_RANDOM_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL

. ham_flush: deprecate, replace w. ham_env_flush? it's already implemented
    o need unittests!?

. evaluate if we can use bamboo for building and testing on multiple
    platforms
    o http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/elastic.jsp#remote
    o install server
    o setup several agents (win32, win64, linux x86, linux x86_64, ...) and
        run either all or only some of the tests, including valgrind!

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. approx. matching: need a sample

. Ger: can specify an initial file size

. how can we merge our ACID transactions/recovery prototype?
    - simplify insert algorithm
    - STRONGLY simplify erase algorithm
    - get rid of the physical logfile
    - use a logical logfile with the current txn implementation
    ----------
    - move limited txn implementation to rb-trees in memory
    ----------
    - add the full ACID stuff

. merge threadsafe code

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper
