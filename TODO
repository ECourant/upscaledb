Items are sorted by priority (highest on top).
o a pending  TODO item (for the current release)
. a pending  TODO item (for future releases)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o documentation on http://hamsterdb.com/public/scripts/html_www/modules.html:
    hamsterdb Cursor Functions is a child of hamsterdb Database Functions - but
    o the filesize of hamsterdb is HUGE (more than 3 times higher than bdb).
        are these pages part of the freelist? extend ham_info to dump 
        information about freelist/used memory ratio
    it should be on the same level!

o Windows: are the file mapping routines really ok? does the file mapping
    handle have to be created over the whole file size? does it have to be
    created with every mmap call??
    o CreateFileMapping: file size can be 0 (will then use the full file size)
    o get a decent profiler
        o win32: evaluate performance with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING 
    	o get rid of copy-on-write! but then we also don't need to pwrite()??
    o test with big file sizes on 32bit Windows - does it fail?
        http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177415
    o unix: in read-only files only map for reading, not for writing
    o why is the file size so huge? we do not store blobs (all records are
        < 8 bytes) -> the freelist is never needed!
        --> it's not the freelist; index pages are split very early and
            therefore are not fully occupied

o can we extend the statistic module to find out if a Database is sequential,
    and then decide to have late page splits when inserting keys?
    o clean up inserts and use routines from hamsterdb v2 (split when 
        descending)

. idea for freelist: we do not have to mark ALL pages in the freelist!
    o use RLE storage for free pages (pages always have the same size, and
        their offset is irrelevant)
    o index pages that are in use do not need to be stored in the freelist
    o use bitmap ONLY for blob pages!
    o need lookup mechanism to map a page ID to a freelist page
        o use a dynamic, sorted table
        o for 256 blob-pages we will have to allocate 1 additional freelist page

. update the Java API 

. update the .NET API 

. update the Python API 

. there are some inconsistencies in the header file
    o HAM_PARAM_DBNAME -> HAM_PARAM_GET_DATABASE_NAME
    o HAM_PARAM_GET_DAM -> HAM_PARAM_GET_DATA_ACCESS_MODE
    o sort the functions and the constants - list constants AFTER
        the first function that they're used for; really have separate
        doxygen sections for each of the groups??

. disallow use of HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS with HAM_SORT_DUPLICATES???
    o documentation
    o unittest
    o remove from monster.sh!

. statistics.c: has big code about cach history which is only used in debug
    mode - check why; can we remove/refactor it?

. create abstraction layer for local Environments/Databases and remote
    Environments/Databases
    o move every local function to local.c

. network-server (use apr, protocol buffers)

. network-client (use apr, protocol buffers)

. pure java network client

. WinCE: create and run Unittests project
    http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/02/23/78930.aspx

. run profiling for duplicate tests - can things be improved?
    o blob_overwrite/duplicate table handling: in some cases we can use
        HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS to speed up things (at least for in-memory)

. webpage changes
    http://www.purenetworks.com/
    http://www.omegathemes.com/tf/smartages/#
    http://eucalyptus.com/
    x the header page image is too large
    o frontpage: have multiple images (scrolling in background) with more
        text info? 
        http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/basic.html
        http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/image-slider/
        http://www.slidedeck.com/
    o sitemap: pulldown with jquery
    o download: need download gates to track in analytics as goals
    o rss feed

. improve documentation/tutorial/faq about
    o confluence is too slow on this server :( Need something else...
    o move some of the documentation and tutorial to a Wiki
        o tutorial (remove from doxygen)
        o samples (remove from doxygen)
        o faq (remove from doxygen)
        o internal developer documentation (remove from doxygen)
    o tutorial/faq: add hinting flags
    o tutorial/faq: add DAMs

. add automatic code coverage using gconv
    http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/gcov/
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html
    http://aleccolocco.blogspot.com/2009/08/sqlite-lesson-in-low-defect-software.html (section "Test Coverage with GCC")
    o track coverage results, publish online
    o gui tools: http://code.google.com/p/trucov/,
                 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggcov/files/ 

. remove HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_RANDOM_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL

. ham_flush: deprecate, replace w. ham_env_flush? it's already implemented
    o need unittests!?

. evaluate if we can use bamboo for building and testing on multiple
    platforms
    o http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/elastic.jsp#remote
    o install server
    o setup several agents (win32, win64, linux x86, linux x86_64, ...) and
        run either all or only some of the tests, including valgrind!

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. approx. matching: need a sample

. Ger: can specify an initial file size

. how can we merge our ACID transactions/recovery prototype?
    - simplify insert algorithm
    - STRONGLY simplify erase algorithm
    - get rid of the physical logfile
    - use a logical logfile with the current txn implementation
    ----------
    - move limited txn implementation to rb-trees in memory
    ----------
    - add the full ACID stuff

. merge threadsafe code

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper
