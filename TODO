-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This branch is in "maintenance mode". New features are on the branch 
"bleeding_edge" (version 2.0.0.rc1 and newer).

x allow files > 2 GB (see TODO on bleeding_edge branch)
x allow cachesize > 4 GB (currently it's a 32bit number)
x new function ham_cursor_get_record_size()
    - remote stub
    - with/without dupes
    - with/without in-memory

o fix performance issues reported by Jake
    o txn_begin does a ham_env_flush, calling db_write_and_delete_page about
        6.7 times. the O(N) loop is the problem (not the flush)
        o every dirty page is stored in a separate list
        o ham_check_integrity: verify this
        o debug build in db_fun_flush: verify this
        o db_fun_flush: use this list for flushing files
    o ham_log_append_prewrite, _write: the memcpy is relatively expensive
        o can we get around it? i.e. using writev?
