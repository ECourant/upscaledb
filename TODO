o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x tutorial (and header file as well?) - default compare is descending, not
    ascending

x merge changes of Ger Hobbelt

x need CREDITS file with contributors

x freel_create can be removed, it's empty

x some unittests are crashing
  x env_create: must write the header-page
  x env_open: must read the header-page
    -> also check Ger's patch

x check why bfc swallows the exceptions

x check ham_get_key_count - implementation/function name

x new append function for ham_cursor_insert: append keys at the "end"
    of the database
    x use it for recno
    x need unittests

x db6.cpp is old, replace it with the original

----- merge
x src/fraction.* - remove if they're not necessary?
x device-filters: currently don't work in logging - remove the new code
    completely? Or leave as much as we can? -> removed
x ham_get_flags deprecated (replaced by ham_get_parameters)!! -> document
x LOCK_EXCLUSIVE is new default? -> document!
x document: AES does not affect the logfile!
x changelist: AES also encrypts header page! (does it??) - no, doesn't!
x backwards compatibility problems - all of them were removed
    x AES has to be enabled *before* env is created
    x KEY_USER_ALLOC needs to have key->size set
        db.c:db_get_extended_key()
    x device-stuff: remove new filters??
x how do we change from AES to AES-CBC in the future? How to recognize
    new encryption modes? -> header page is not encrypted! can store flags...
x remove all code and references of HAM_KEYSIZE_TOO_SMALL
x remove all code and references of HAM_RECORDSIZE_TOO_SMALL
x review public interface and documentation of approx. matching
x check HAM_INVALID_PAGEFILTER_PAGESIZE - still needed?
x check HAM_INVALID_PAGEFILTER_DESIGN - still needed?
x check HAM_FILTER_NOT_FOUND_IN_CHAIN - still needed?
x garbagelist was removed - kann be removed from page.h? what happens with
    deleted pages? - no, not removed, still needed
x remove raw_pagesize/cooked_pagesize - we do not distinguish!
x __check_create_parameters: is the RETURN macro still necessary? - yes
x update cpp API!
    x ham_key_get_approximate_match_type
    x ham_get_key_count
    x ham_get_parameters
    x ham_env_get_parameters
x ham_clean_statistics_datarec is a public function - are there other public
    functions? review interfaces
x EnvTest::createAndOpenMultiDbTest: disabled; the last (256.) call of 
    ham_env_create_db creates valgrind errors (-> even crashes)
x freelist16: is this tested in the unittests?
x freelist.c: has __inline keyword - not portable!

o tools
o samples
o win32 build environment??

o DAM - really be backwards compatible?? or upgrade the files to 1.1.0?
    x review freelist code
    o review DAM related code in hamsterdb.h and src/
    o limit allowed DAM combinations - otherwise we have to test too much!
        o unittests
    o make sure that HAM_DAM_ENFORCE_PRE110_FORMAT cannot be set from user
        (only automatically by loading a file from 1.0.9)
        o unittests
    o what if an unknown DAM is set? -> fail to load??
    o ham_info: print the DAM (but only if it's persistent!)
    o enhance acceptance tests - need to support DAMs
    o enhance monster.sh

HAM_DAM_RANDOM_WRITE_ACCESS
HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT
HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT
HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT|HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT
HAM_DAM_ENFORCE_PRE110_FORMAT

----

o approx. matching: need a sample

x IMPORTANT!!! - increase libtool version by 1??? also, we have some API
    incompatibilities when HAM_*_USER_ALLOC is used. are they a problem??
    -> incompatibilities were removed; increment version nevertheless??
    --> no, only increment revision

o add/fix testing of the tools to the release process

o packstop has include guards??? remove them, run tests
    x implement
    o make sure that databases from 1.0.9 are still working in 1.1.0

o do lots of testing with databases from 1.0.9 - must be loaded/modified 
    flawlessly (add unittests!)

o doxygen: make sure that all new functions are shown correctly. 

o doxygen: the online css is super ugly. use the original layout and change the
    online integration

o make sure that unittests are not executed twice (move registration out of
    constructor)

. in-memory-db could access directly the record (and then overwrite it)
    -> needs new flag for ham_find/ham_cursor_move
    o unittests

. unittests: get rid of cppunit, move to bfc
    x update unittests
    o update win32 project file
    o update wince project file
    . update hamsterdb-alien
    o finally run tests in win64
    o finally run tests in wince
    o make sure that all tests are run only once (don't register tests in
         the constructor of a fixture)

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

----------

. enhance java/python/.NET for transactions and approx matching
    o update README file(s) with new address
    o python: we now have a ham_get_key_count() function and do not need the
        slow iteration code anymore

. enhance acceptance tests - will need new test scripts
    TXN_BEGIN 1  (1 is the txn id)
    TXN_ABORT 1
    TXN_INSERT 1 ...
    TXN_ERASE 1 ...
    TXN_COMMIT 1

. release-process: enhance automated tests of win32/win64 dll and lib

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. tests are failing because of a berkeleydb bug:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch
