o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x tutorial (and header file as well?) - default compare is descending, not
    ascending

x packstop has include guards??? remove them, run tests

x merge changes of Ger Hobbelt

x need CREDITS file with contributors

x freel_create can be removed, it's empty

x some unittests are crashing
  x env_create: must write the header-page
  x env_open: must read the header-page
    -> also check Ger's patch

x check why bfc swallows the exceptions

o new append function for ham_cursor_insert: append keys at the "end"
    of the database
    x use it for recno
    o need unittests

o approx. matching: need a sample

o recno: set HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT for record number databases

o what if an unknown DAM is set? -> fail to load??

o need new framework to install freelist handlers
    o use the current code for databases created with hamsterdb <= 1.0.9
    o use the new code for everything else

o ham_xx_get_parameter: the maxkey value is calculated twice, and not correct

o doxygen: make sure that all new functions are shown correctly. 

o doxygen: the online css is super ugly. use the original layout and change the
    online integration

o make sure that unittests are not executed twice (move registration out of
    constructor)

o unittests: get rid of cppunit, move to bfc
    x update unittests
    o update win32 project file
    o update wince project file
    . update hamsterdb-alien
    o finally run tests in win64
    o finally run tests in wince
    o make sure that all tests are run only once (don't register tests in
         the constructor of a fixture)
