o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x release 0.4.8 

x update webpage
    x C++ API: add documentation to webpage
    x add FAQ entry about security (AES related)
    x add FAQ why C++ cursor is not stl-compatible

x be more careful when uncoupling cursors - especially when inserting 
    or deleting items, uncoupling is often not necessary
    x definitely no need to uncouple if overwriting or adding a duplicate
    x often no need to uncouple when inserting/splitting
    x unittests: 
        x create cursor -> must be NIL
        x insert item   -> must be NIL
        x move cursor to item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert item2 < item -> cursor is coupled
        x insert duplicate of item -> cursor is still coupled
        x insert item2 > item -> cursor is uncoupled

x enhance acceptance tests
    x acceptance test: encryption is missing
    x new acceptance tests with many, many duplicates

x make sure we fail to open databases which have incompatible versions

x compression: store the size of the uncompressed data as the first 4 byte
    in the blob; then uncompression is easier and faster
    x unittest w/ HAM_RECORD_USER_ALLOC

x remove TODOs in the source

x command line tool ham_info
    usage: ham_info [-db dbname] [-f] filename
        -db: prints only stats about this database
        -f: (--full) - number of items, average key size, average data
            size, min/max sizes, number of extended keys
    x create autotools infrastructure
    x list environment information
    x list database information
    x list full database information
    x create automated tests
    x create msvc projects

x command line tool ham_dump: dumps keys and records
    usage: ham_dump [-key format] [-record format] 
                [-maxkey n] [-maxrec n] [-db dbname] filename
    x create autotools infrastructure
    x create msvc projects
    x dump key/record: numeric|string|binary
    x create automated tests
 
x command line tools must be installed; currently, automake does not
    install them

o run extensive tests on sparc architecture

o do benchmarking with 1 mio inserts/reads

o do benchmarking on windows, esp. with and without mmap

o win64: debug builds fail in mmap routines
    -> workaround: link against release libraries??

o autoconf: check if flock, LOCK_EX etc exist and make sure we don't
    fail on solaris 5.9

o c++ API: should not fail when closing an environment, but databases
    are still open
    o store all open databases in a std::map in the environment
    o when closing the environment, close all open databases
    o same for databases and cursors

o c++ API: cursors should be compatible to bi-directional STL-iterators
    -> need ++ and -- (prefix only)
    -> rend and rbegin
    -> end: is not the last element, but a symbolic "end"-element
    -> begin: if it fails, must return end()
    -> operator*: returns std::pair<key, record>
    -> operator->: i->first(), i->second()
    -> operator== and operator!=, operator= and copy-constructor

o ham_get_version: get char**-parameter to retrieve the licensed modules,
    i.e. "SRT" - Commercial, Storage, Recovery, Transactions
    or "" - for unlicensed GPL version
    x is there something similar for berkdb or QT? -> yes, QT
    x does this make sense anyway? -> yes, seems so
    x prepare and think through licensing concept
    o add API function and license.h (??)

o check roadmap.txt for other TODO items

o add documentation for the command line tools

o release 0.4.9

o make sure that the test coverage is as high as possible

. do a complete source code review, or ask someone to do it;

. webpage
    o move to cakephp framework (or a cms? enanocms.com?)
    o frontpage: resize hamster picture; remove text -> more space below
        (for 3 colums: news, main features, articles/testimonials/link cloud)
    o rss feed

. need acceptance tests for duplicates-before, -after, -first

. improve test coverage on windows (run unittests, samples and tools)

. tests are failing:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1 -- berkeley bug
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch

. create a new repository for hamsterdb-alien for all dependencies 
    in source and precompiled (static/non-debug - cppunit and berkeleydb)
    x linux64-le
    x linux32-le
    x win32
    o cygwin32
    o win64
    o wince-x86
    o ppc32-be
    o sparc-32
