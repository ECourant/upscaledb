x make sure that --mmap=0 really disables mmap (getopt-problem?)

x new flag HAM_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE
    x implementation
        x for linux/posix
        x for win32
    x documentation
    x test
        x linux
        x windows

x allow x64-bit builds with MSVC/Visual Studio Solution file

x move blobid handling of extended keys to its own function

x extkey-refactoring
    x free all extkeys! (search for blob_frees)
        -> debug && inmemorydb: assert that the extkey-cache is empty
           AFTER the extkeys were freed
    x extkeys need an "age"; use (npers) txn_id as an age
    x when purging the cache, also purge the extkeys (but not too often - 
        only when the cache is too full and txn_id%10==0)
        x extkeys, which are older than 5 txn's, are marked for removal

x do some profiling - make sure that the extkey-cache is not a bottleneck
    -> no, we're really great

o remove TODOs (grep for @@@), if tests run on PowerPC

o write more unittests
    x keys.c/keys.h
    x extkeys.c/extkeys.h (also test the caching behaviour!)
    o blob.c/blob.h

    o trying to open/create databases with invalid page sizes, key sizes,
        invalid flag combinations etc
    o negative tests for all public functions!

o fix ALL compiler warnings
    x gcc 4.x
    o gcc 3.x
    o msvc

o port to QNX (?)

o completely automate the release-process for the tar-ball

o release 0.4.4!
