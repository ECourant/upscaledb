o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x release 0.4.8 

o update webpage
    x C++ API: add documentation to webpage
    o add FAQ entry about security (AES related)
    o add FAQ why C++ cursor is not stl-compatible

o acceptance test: encryption is missing

o compression: store the size of the uncompressed data as the first 8 byte
    in the blob; then uncompression is easier and faster

o get a working qemu image for sparc and powerpc, and start extensive testing

o remove TODOs in the source

o do benchmarking with 1 mio inserts/reads

o do benchmarking on windows, esp. with and without mmap

o win64: debug builds fail in mmap routines
    -> workaround: link against release libraries??

o key_set_record does not always need to dirty the page (i.e. when
    appending duplicates) -> don't set page dirty in the caller
    (but that's not important and will not result in performance improvements
     in 99.99% of all cases, because the page will get dirty by other inserts)

o cursor_overwrite/cursor_insert: 
    currently, the cursor_dupe_cache is deleted, but we don't have to
    also, in cursor_move there are some optimizations regarding the
    cache (search for TODO)

o be more careful when uncoupling cursors - especially when inserting 
    or deleting items, uncoupling is often not necessary
    o definitely no need to uncouple if overwriting or adding a duplicate
    o unittests: 
        o create cursor -> must be NIL
        o insert item   -> must be NIL
        o move cursor to item
        o insert item2 < item -> cursor is uncoupled
        o move cursor to item
        o insert duplicate of item -> cursor is still coupled
        o insert item2 > item -> cursor is still coupled







o tests are failing:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1 -- berkeley bug
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch

o create a new repository for hamsterdb-alien for all dependencies 
    in source and precompiled (static/non-debug - cppunit and berkeleydb)
    x linux64-le
    x linux32-le
    x win32
    o cygwin32
    o win64
    o wince-x86
    o ppc32-be

o modify acceptance test for --duplicate=1 (berkdb and hamster)
    o new acceptance tests with many, many duplicates
    o --duplicate-position="before"|"after"|"first"|"last"(default)
        o add to monster.sh
        o add to valgrind.sh

o command line tool ham_info
o command line tool ham_dump
o command line tool ham_recovery

. do a complete source code review, or ask someone to do it;
    make sure that the test coverage is as high as possible

. webpage
    o move to cakephp framework
    o frontpage: resize hamster picture; remove text -> more space below
        (for 3 colums: news, main features, articles/testimonials/link cloud)
