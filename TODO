This Branch Is About Integrating The hamsterdb2 Functionality!!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a user i want to run many Transactions in parallel with high performance.
I'm not interested in multiple threads (yet), although i may use several 
threads (but then i'll use synchronization in my own code).
==============================================================================

x new code is only active if HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS is specified; 
    otherwise everything stays as is
    x allow more than one txn in parallel
    x don't need DO_NOT_NUKE_PAGE_STATS as flag for txn_abort/commit
    x env_flush_committed_txns() - must clear txn from list
    x rewrite auto-abort/auto-commit

o manage all transactions
    x integrate existing rb-tree code from hamsterdb2
        x rb.h
        x txns are linked lists (chronological) 
        x this tree stores operations for each key
            x create txn_op structure
            x create insert(update) and erase operations
            x each op is stored chronologically in the txn AND in the rb-node
        x each database has such a tree
    x remove the whole transaction handling from the low-level page
        i/o routines
        x also remove refcounts in the pages, replace with
            page_lock
            page_unlock
            page_is_locked
        x remove PAGE_LIST_TXN
    x remove env_get_txn, env_get_txn_id
        distinguish: on high level, we have multiple txns
        on low level, we use the lsn for file-io routines
            x extkeys.c - extkey_set_txn_id: replace with lsn
            x keys.c: move page_get_btree_node functions to btree.c; can we
                move everything else into util.c?
            x make sure that page_get_btree_node() is only called in
                btree_*.c 
                key_compare_pub_to_int
                key_compare_int_to_int
            x btree_close_cursors - actually in use? - yes
            x db.h - cleanup high level i/o interface
            x util.h - cleanup 
            x blob.h - cleanup interface if possible
            x page.h - cleanup 
            x rename int_key_t to btree_key_t
            x rename statistics.c to btree_stats.c (and rename the functions)

    o rewrite ham_insert
        x need functions to create trees/nodes/ops
                tree=txn_tree_get_or_create(db)
                node=txn_node_get_or_create(tree, key)
                op=txn_op_create(node, flags, record) -> store the full record!
                    -> all ops are in two linked lists!
        x if transactions are disabled: immediately write to disk, no
            temp transactions are needed
        x each modified database gets its own txn tree when its modified
            in a transaction
        x for now do not write the blob to disk but keep it in memory
        x otherwise insert into transaction tree
        x need a new error code HAM_TXN_CONFLICT
        x check for transaction conflicts (similar to ham2)

    o add unittests for all the stuff I did so far

    o rewrite ham_find
        o each modified database gets its own txn tree when its modified
            in a transaction
        o if transactions are disabled: immediately write to disk, no
            temp transactions are needed
        o otherwise go through transaction trees
    o rewrite ham_erase
        o each modified database gets its own txn tree when its modified
            in a transaction
        o if transactions are disabled: immediately write to disk, no
            temp transactions are needed
        o otherwise go through transaction trees
    o lsn is missing! it should come either from the env or from the log 
        (but the log does not always exist)
    o implement env_flush_committed_txns()
    o add new unittests
    o make sure all unittests are running
    o review page.h - anything that we do not need? (i.e. dirty_txn?)

    o more pending cleanups
        o remove env_get_txn, env_get_txn_id
        o extkeys: don't use txn_id for the 'age', use lsn instead

o each operation writes a journal entry (however, we still keep the logical
        journal in parallel, otherwise the unittests will fail completely)
        o write entry for db_find
        o write entry for db_insert
        o write entry for db_erase
    o recovery: recreate all pending transactions (if requested)
    o unittests

o ham_txn_begin receives Environment handle, not Database handle
    o need a new parameter (reserved) for parent txn
    o need a new parameter for txn name (string)
    o update unittests/add new tests
    o update C++ API
    o rewrite auto-abort/auto-commit -> move to env

o new API to retrieve the currently active transactions
    o already exists
    o needs unittests

o continue as described in integrate-ham2.txt...
