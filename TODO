o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x doxygen: make sure that all new functions are shown correctly. 

x doxygen: the online css is super ugly. use the original layout and change the
    online integration

x doxygen: the generated html files should be part of the tarball

x Ger has some more updates, esp. in unittests (merge stuff from his
    mails)

x consequently store database files from every supported version on 
    every supported platform:
    1.0.9
        win32-msvc8
        win64-msvc8
        linux32-ubuntu-x86
        macos-ppc-86
        etc
        -> uname -p + '_' + uname -s + '_' + <compiler>
    x write/use a perl script which creates the name!
    x define which tests are stored
    x one script generates those files
    x also copy `test` and the used libraries (and at least link test 
            statically!)
    x another script compares against files in EACH subdirectory
        (FULLCHECK, then do a few hundred operations of all kinds - dupes,
         overwrites, insert, find, erase, extkeys etc)
            1, 46, 220, 53, ext_061
    x include performance data when generating the files
    x generate files for 1.0.9
    x generate files for 1.1.0 on linux, run compare tests (warning - 
        current HEAD is no longer 1.1.0 - make sure that we test the 
        right sources!)
    x generate files for 1.1.0 on win32, run compare tests (warning - 
        current HEAD is no longer 1.1.0 - make sure that we test the 
        right sources!)

x unittest:
    create database (not in Env!) and make sure that the database
    name is 0xf000 (EMPTY_DATABASE_NAME)
    x EMPTY_DATABASE_NAME is a stupid name - better use DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME

x compression is not a persistent flag - should it be? if not, then 
    document it!

x ham_get_parameter should return DAM

o Ger sent new statistics.c with minor fixes - it's on crupp.de:~
    o merge - but doesn't work yet! Wait for new fixes...
    o run monster.sh

o code cleanup: HAM_DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME and other reserved names are not
    allowed to be used from the users; but HAM_FIRST_DATABASE_NAME is
    allowed!
    o Hamsterdb::checkDatabaseNameTest()

o make sure that unittests are not executed twice (move registration out of
    constructor)

o acceptance tests do not cover HAM_HINT_*

o in-memory-db could access directly the record (and then overwrite it)
    -> needs new flag for ham_find/ham_cursor_move
    o unittests
    o can we add this to monster.sh?

o make environment pointer obligatory - ham_create[_ex] and ham_open[_ex]
    create a private environment handle if it was not supplied
    o don't forget to close/delete the handle!
    o clean up db.h/db.c code
    o move code from ham_create[_ex] into ham_env_create_db?
    o move code from ham_open[_ex] into ham_env_open_db?

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

o re-enable HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT
    o acceptance tests fail, i.e. ./test --keysize=680 --duplicate=1 
        -dam HAM_DAM_FAST_INSERT ../../testfiles/1/190.tst (and others)
    o re-enable tests in monster.sh

. approx. matching: need a sample

. sort duplicate keys - Ger has patches

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

----------

. enhance java/python/.NET for transactions and approx matching
    o update README file(s) with new address
    o python: we now have a ham_get_key_count() function and do not need the
        slow iteration code anymore

. enhance acceptance tests - will need new test scripts
    TXN_BEGIN 1  (1 is the txn id)
    TXN_ABORT 1
    TXN_INSERT 1 ...
    TXN_ERASE 1 ...
    TXN_COMMIT 1

. release-process: enhance automated tests of win32/win64 dll and lib

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. tests are failing because of a berkeleydb bug:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch
