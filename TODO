This Branch Is About Integrating The hamsterdb2 Functionality!!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The big headline is:
As a user i want to run many Transactions in parallel with high performance.
I'm using multiple threads b/c my CPU has multiple cores, and expect hamsterdb
to scale with the number of cores.
==============================================================================

high-level plan for 2.1.8 pro ..............................................
x all changes of APL version
x SIMD for default layout/PAX keylists

    x document the flag
    x do not allow with in-memory Environments
        x unittest
    x flag is not persisted
        x unittest

        (if page has a header)
    x multipage blobs: store in PBlobPageHeader::m_free_bytes
    x add to ham_bench
    x add unittest
        x corrupt a page
        x allocate, read, overwrite, erase etc multi-page blobs
        x corrupt a multi-page blob
    x add to monster-pro tests (incl. reopen, big blobs, overwrite)

    x apl: support and document the flag, but return error if selected
        x add to java api
        x add to .NET api
        x add to python api

        page allocation fails!
    x device_disk.h: cache the file size (but verify it in debug builds)
    x add parameter and documentation (header file)
        HAM_PARAM_FILE_SIZE: 0x00000109
    x fail if in-memory db
        x unittest
    x device_disk.h: check for the file size limit (default: 0xffffffffff...)
    x add unittest
        x check integrity after a split
        x when allocating a blob: make sure that the inserted key is removed
            afterwards (check integrity)
    x add to java
    x add to .NET
    x add to python
    x add to erlang

x hola: extend the documentation

    x bin16, use count_if() of all keys with a certain postfix ("X")

    x make sure that the hamsterdb databases are using the correct parameters
        x bin16 should use fixed length keys

    x SSD: run each with 100k, 1m, 10m and 100m keys (4 mb cache)
    x SSD: run each with 100k, 1m, 10m and 100m keys (1 gb cache)
    x HDD: run each with 100k, 1m, 10m and 100m keys (4 mb cache)
    x HDD: run each with 100k, 1m, 10m and 100m keys (1 gb cache)

x make sure that hamsterdb/master can compile against libuv 0.10.25
    x rebase v2 to master
    x rebase pro to base

o PRO: use a bitmap index for recnos
    -> can we come up with a solution that also works for non-recnos?
        then we need to implement sparse indices (maybe even compress them
        with RLEs)
    -> compression idea:
        a "BitVector" is a bitmap stored in 32bit
        2 bits per BitVector for flags
            00: BitVector contains all zeroes (-> macromap is not required)
            11: BitVector contains all ones (-> macromap is not required)
            10: BitVector contains a bitmap (-> macromap is required)
        a "minimap" is a set of flags (32bit -> 16 flags) with the corresponding
            (unknown) number of macromaps; minimum size is 4 bytes, 
            maximum is sizeof(T) + 17 * 4 = sizeof(T) + 68

    o implement a testable template version of a minimap
        template parameters: type T (uint16, uint32, uint64)
                number of 2bit flags
        x needs to shrink if all bits of a word are set (or not set)
        x must iterate; use precomputed lookup-table for the flag word
        x should be serialized in a flat buffer
        x must be able to insert/append, flip bits, test bits
        o sparsemap: add another layer on top of this which manages a variable
            number of minimaps, and can iterate, lookup and insert
            x all minimap offsets must be aligned to their capacity! otherwise
                they must get merged and this creates awful complexity
            x must be able to insert/append, test bits
            x use a fixed length memory block instead of std::vector
            o many unittests
                x set range(1..10000), test if bit is set
                o unset range(1..10000), test if bit is set
            o remove the TODOs
            o add more tests
                o set range(1..10000) in reverse order
                o unset range(1..10000) in reverse order
                o add multiple MiniMaps
        o check for overflow when growing
        o improve performance
            o very fast code path for appending bits (recno!)
            o fast random access (use lookup table of minimaps and
                    their offsets)
        o refactor/beautify code

    o need new parameter/compression type; store it persistently
        o unittest
    o create a resizable KeyList based on a sparsemap
        o needs fixes in adjust_capacity??
    o search: use skip-list approach? binary search will be inefficient
        o needs fixes in insert(), erase()? currently uses slots, but should
            use numeric key instead
    o btree split: pivot interface must be chosen (or "adjusted") by the KeyList
    o for hola scans: don't use iterators but uncompress keys in a 4kb-buffer
        (-> caller interface can stay as is)
    o use KeyList only for leafs (b/c keys in the internal nodes are too sparse)
    o document - write a paper etc to claim prior art; release code as a
        separate open-source library (GPL)?

o PRO: use grouped varints for the RecordLists
    o should work for InternalRecordList (64bit record IDs)
        record ID could be modulo page-size (makes numbers smaller)
    o also for DefaultRecordList, if flags are separated from the record id's
    o and for default records
        o in this case the record flags should also be "compressed"
    o can also be used for PodKeyList<uint32> and PodKeyList<uint64>?
    o GroupedVarints should be parameterized and work for 32bit and 64bit
        numbers and a variety of capacities
    https://github.com/stuhood/gvi/blob/master/src/main/java/net/hoodidge/gvi/GroupVarInt.java
    http://www.oschina.net/code/snippet_12_5083
    http://www.ir.uwaterloo.ca/book/addenda-06-index-compression.html
    -> the concept will be similar to prefix compression
    -> can we come up with a schema that allows compression AND
        fast random access?

o webpage changes
    o give away for free to non-profits
    o also add a startup program?
    o add CRC32 to pro documentation, feature matrix

. documentation rewrite
    o use github wiki
        o remove old cruft

------------- hamsterdb 2.1.9 ----------------------------------------

o erlang: 2 tests are failing

o java still has license.java/version.java - remove!
    o also check dotnet!

o remove version.h, embed in hamsterdb.h

o improve performance for hola-sum (profile!)
    s1 = a1 + b1
    s2 = a2 + b2
    s3 = a3 + b3
    s4 = a4 + b4
    return s1 + s2 + s3 + s4

o can we add a generic macro like this:
    #define ham_initialize_key(PTR, SIZE)   { SIZE, PTR, 0, 0}
    which can be used as an initializer:
    ham_key_t key = ham_initialize_key("hello", 5);
    o same for records
    o use in samples
    o use in source
    o use in unittests
    o document

o refactoring: it would be nicer if the ham_paramter_t lists are passed to
    the Environment implementation and do not have to be parsed in hamsterdb.cc
    (see HAM_PARAM_FILE_SIZE, which is not relevant for in-memory and remote
    Environments)
    - db_config.h: a class with the run-time configuration of
        the database
    - env_config.h: a class with the run-time configuration of
        the environment
    - These classes initialize themselves with the parameters supplied by
        the user, and call all other modules (device, cache...) with this
        structure as the parameter for initialization
    - All getters of these classes are const/immutable

o refactoring: improve the code separation of cursor and txn_cursor, i.e.
    in db_local::cursor_get_record_size (wtf - is_null(0)?)
    etc

o QuickCheck: create a new property for testing duplicates; the key is always
    the same. The number of duplicate keys is tracked and periodically
    checked with the API. A cursor can be used to remove a specific
    duplicate, or to fetch a specific duplicate.

o delta updates managed in the BtreeNode
    the operations are attached to the node, but as soon as the node
    is accessed for a lookup or a scan, or immediately before the node
    is flushed, the deltas are merged into the node. So far this does not
    sound too efficient, but the bulk updates in combination with the
    key compression (i.e. for prefix compression) will benefit a lot.

    Also, they are really required for concurrency and to allow multiple
    writers in parallel.

    x perform a benchmark/profiling: random inserts vs. ascending inserts;
        the difference should be caused by memcopy/memmove (is it?)
        x PAX
            -> absolutely worth the effort, about 60% are spent in memmove
        x Default
            -> also worth the effort, about 15% are spent in memmove

    o need a flag to disable DeltaUpdates
        o add flag to ham_bench
    o rename TransactionOperation to DeltaUpdate, decouple code from txn
    o totally transparent to the caller, handled in the proxy
    o only add deltas to leaf nodes; internal nodes have too many read
        operations and would anyway require immediate flushes
    o DeltaUpdate objects from a txn-flush should directly go down to
        the node (detach from txn, attach to node)
    o should the the insert + set_record operations be combined into a
        single call? this has the additional advantage that the overhead
        of calling set_record will disappear
    o merge delta updates when reading and flushing
        o however, for simple lookup calls (no duplicates) the DUs can
            be traversed, too 
    o requires_split() must take delta updates into account
    o make the merge algorithm as efficient as possible
        o sort deltas by key
        o first execute all 'erase' either against other deltas or against
            the node
        o then merge the remaining inserts
        o this needs lots of tests
    o now run tests: should every update be stored as a DeltaUpdate? If not
        then disable them by default, unless Transactions are used (and unless
        bulk updates are used)

o use cache-oblivious b-tree layout
    ===> a much simpler approach would be to reserve "X" bytes when creating
        the environment (and then map the whole range)
        this would include storage for the blobs AND we would not have to mess
        around with the mapping
    -> http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cacheObliviousBTree.html
    o see roadmap document for more information
    o this feature is *per database*
    o calculate number of reqd pages based on estimated keys from the user
        (but what about the blobs??)
    o make sure that this is not reverted when "reduce file size" feature
        (above) is enabled
    o the new pages are not managed by the freelist! therefore the freelist
        will not need any modifications
    o after resize: mmap the whole file area. this is actually important because
        mmap is much faster than r/w; but when the database is created, the
        original mapping already exists. therefore we might have to handle
        more than one mapping in the file
    o PageManager: when allocating a new page then use the distribution
        function to fetch a page from the reserved storage
    . try to batch allocations; when new pages are required then don't just
        allocate one but multiple pages (if the database is big enough)
        -> could create a second memory mapping for the next chunk

o windows cleanups
    o need win32 python project (or wait till someone needs it?)
    o a few projects are not built (hamzilla_debug_x64, server_dll_x64...)
        or end up in wrong directories
    o C# unittests sporadically fail b/c a handle is closed multiple times
    o automate the build process
    o ... and the packaging

o improve node layout compression (when the file format changes)
    -> btw: flags are not required at all if fixed length record size > 8
        (and record size is too large for inline records)
    o PAX Layout: can compress the flags for the DefaultRecordList
    o Default Layout: can compress the flags for the Duplicate*RecordList

o release-v2.pl: valgrind takes sooo long. should we use clang's
    AddressSanitizer instead? or both?

. hola - next steps
    o support java api
    o support .net api
    o support erlang api
    o PRO: lua-functions as callbacks - then remote marshalling will work
    o add remote support where it makes sense (only for PRO?)

. architecture for a new webpage
    o pick an awesome design
        i.e. similar to http://foundationdb.com, http://laravel.com,
        http://rethinkdb.com, http://www.orientechnologies.com
    o use make/m4/markdown to generate static pages:
        https://github.com/datagrok/m4-bakery
        https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/
    o come up with the full site structure/contents
        o include full documentation, one page per API
        o ... and for all languages
        o keep the documentation in the source tree, not in -www?
    o documentation comments are hosted on disqus
    o blog comments are hosted on disqus, articles are also written in markup

    o static pages will be served with nginx, using url rewrites
    o dynamic pages are created with a micro-framework (silex?)
    o Makefile can "scp -r" everything to the servers (staging or production)

    . client area with (low priority)
        o authentication
        o collection of files
        o analytics (who downloads what and when?)
    . admin area with (even lower priority)
        o authentication
        o customer database
        o implementing business processes
        o sending out release emails
        o importing new releases
        o etc

. look into spark and mongodb integration
    -> would be an interesting market with requirements for column store
        storage
    -> how does the integration look like?
    -> has TPC-benchmarks and other benchmarks ready
    o write down everything i find, collect information and estimate
        efforts/gains (will do the same for mysql, R and mongodb later); this
        task is not about writing code!

------------- hamsterdb pro 2.1.9 ------------------------------------

o PRO: bulk updates
    - require delta updates
    - give users API to allocate memory for keys/records
    - if user says that data is already sorted then do not re-sort, but
        fail hard if the sort order is violated
    - add those delta updates to the txn-trees or to the btree node,
        simply transfer ownership of the memory
    -> or are these "batched" updates, in combination with cache-oblivious
        btrees? the batched updates contain lists of structures with
        information about the update (i.e. insert, erase etc). internally,
        a cursor is used to perform the update. this would be fast and a
        relatively cheap way to perform multiple operations in one
        single transaction. and they would not require delta updates, but
        still provide real value.
    o also for remote, transfer in a single message
    o also for .NET
    o also for java
    o also for erlang
    o also for python

o PRO: prefix compression for variable-length keys
    ==> not efficient for random read/writes, but that's ok. linear scans
        and appends will nevertheless be fast, and the delta updates
        will make it efficient too 
    ==> when performing bulk updates/batched updates, make sure that the
        page is compressed only once
    ==> only for leaf keys!? internal keys have too much "distance", and
        the decompression would require too much time
    ==> implement this as an "aspect" for the default-layout with
        variable-sized keys

    o if key is appended at the end: just write the delta
    o every "n'th" (50th?) key is written uncompressed
    o otherwise append a delta-update to the page, and "merge" all deltas
        before the page is flushed. This will improve performance for batched
        updates, since they will cause only one page compression for
        multiple updates.
    o however, it's tricky to figure out whether a node requires a split or
        not, since it requires a good estimate of the size for the new key 
        -> if in doubt then just perform the merge
    
    o full keys can be further compressed with lzf or lzo
    o key search: jumps from full key to full key; in between, there's a
        linear search for the key

------------- hamsterdb 2.1.9 ---------------------------------------

. hola: use sum-prefix-trees to precalculate partial sums/results?
    they could be stored in a btree, and used to dynamically recalculate
    requested values 
    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/papers/Ble93.pdf

o QuickCheck: automatically test the recovery feature by invoking "crashes"

o the bucket for concurrency TODOs
    this are the requirements:
    - PRO: inserts are fully concurrent (APL: only one insert at a time)
    - transactions are flushed in background
    - dirty pages are flushed in background
    - reading pages is synchronous, writing pages is asynchronous
        -> needs a very fast locking scheme
    - SSDs support many async. writes in parallel - be prepared!

    o an intermediate stage would be to have concurrent reads but exclusive
        writes (one writer, many readers) - makes sense?

    o create coding rules
        o synchronization either in lowest or highest level of the callstack
        o when to use what kind of synchronization
        o which modules are single-threaded/synchronized, which are atomic,
            which are concurrent?

    o how can we verify the correctness of the implementation?
        - i.e. by using static analysis or dynamic analysis, together
            with annotated code/custom tools? even if these tools do not
            exist then a system of annotations/naming conventions can help
            writing/maintaining the code

    o mutex implementations should have built-in monitoring, i.e.
        number of locks/unlocks, wait times, contention etc

    o come up with a list of all functions, define which locking operation
        is required; then review the code and make sure this will work
        o the environment configuration
        o the database configuration
        o the transaction tree handling
        o the page manager, the device and the cache
        o the btree
        o the btree nodes (i.e. extkeycache, compressor)
        o parallel lookups (using the same memory arena)

    o reduce the linked lists - they're hard to be updated with atomic
        operations
        o page
        o transaction and dependent objects
        o ...

    o separate SMOs from the actual operation (#2)
        -> check the literature
        http://pdf.aminer.org/000/409/763/b_trees_with_relaxed_balance.pdf
        o move SMO operations to "the janitor" (btree_janitor.h)

    o the global environment-lock should go because it's expensive; rather
        increment an atomic latch, and refuse to close/erase the database as
        long as the latch is > 0 




o PRO: hot backups (vacuumizes to a different file)
    - copies the database file
    - if compaction is enabled: copies keys w/ iterator
        (later: performs bulk updates)
    - then applies all committed transactions to the other file
    --> think this through; how to deal with delta updates? -> merge them
        what if only a few databases should be backed up?
        what if i want to back up in a logical format (i.e. csv)?

o "hola" - olap functions that operate directly on the btree data
    -> see wiki
    -> see java8 stream API:
        http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html
    -> see supersonic:
        https://code.google.com/p/supersonic/
    -> see fast bitmap indices
        http://code.google.com/p/lemurbitmapindex/
    o create a design
    o operations on compressed data (COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), ...)?
    o use async operations or futures/promises
    o deprecate ham_db_get_key_count() (tutorial, documentation)

- bloom filter -> PRO
- concurrency -> PRO

. clean up approx. matching
    o ONLY for cursors
    o Flags: HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH (default)
    o lookup: the cursor is coupled to the key, even if the lookup fails
        then perform a lookup:
            found_key == requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
            found_key < requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
            found_key > requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
    o must work with transactions
    o do not store key flags; the caller has to compare the key
    o remove ham_key_set_intflags, ham_key_get_intflags, key->_flags (?)

. win32: need a release-v2.pl which fully automates the various release steps
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2008
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2010
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o build release package

. also remove locking from C# and Java APIs

------------------- idea soup ---------------------------------------------

. PRO: should we have a separate "recsize == 0" RecordList for duplicates?
    they could only store the duplicate count (but should be able to deal
    with duplicates that are > 256!)
    -> requires grouped varints

o asynchronous prefetching of pages
    -> see posix_fadvice, libprefetch

o when recovering, give users the choice if active transactions should be
    aborted (default behavior) or re-created
    o needs a function to enumerate them

o A new transactional mode: read-only transactions can run "in the past" - only
    on committed transactions. therefore they avoid conflicts and will always
    succeed.

o need a function to get the txn of a conflict (same as in v2)
    ham_status_t ham_txn_get_conflicting_txn(ham_txn_t *txn, ham_txn_t **other);
        oder: txn-id zurückgeben? sonst gibt's ne race condition wenn ein anderer
        thread "other" committed/aborted
    o also add to c++ API
    o add documentation (header file)
    o add documentation (wiki)

. new test case for cursors
    insert (1, a)
    insert (1, b) (duplicate of 1)
    move (last) (-> 1, b)
    insert (1, c)
    move (last) (-> 1, c)? is the dupecache updated correctly?

. there are a couple of areas where a btree cursor is uncoupled, just to
    retrieve the key and to couple the txn-key. that's not efficient
        db.c:__btree_cursor_points_to
        db.c:__compare_cursors
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_sync
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_overwrite
    o move to a separate function
    o try to optimize

. add tests to verify that the cursor is not modified if an operation fails!
    (in cursor.cpp:LongTxnCursorTest are some wrapper functions to move or
    insert the cursor; that's a good starting point)
