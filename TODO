o a pending  TODO item (normal priority)
. a pending  TODO item (low priority)
x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o new web page
    x link-cloud: add link to forum
    o add google sitemap
    o update samples for C/C++ (if necessary)
    o add documentation for Java
    o add documentation for .NET (chm file)
    o add samples for Java
    o add samples for .NET
    o add samples for Python
    o add RSS/Atom feed
    o add google sitemap

x add commercial license to source repositories (all of them!), update README
    and all header file comments

x new Python release
    x update for logging/recovery
    x upload to webpage, update freshmeat

o new Java release
    x update for logging/recovery
    x need win32/win64 binaries
    o upload to webpage, update freshmeat

o new .NET release
    x update for logging/recovery
    o prepare package and documentation
    o upload to webpage, update freshmeat

o C++ API
    o why does the assignment operator of db() close the database?
        doesn't it then close the database handle???

o tools/tests/test.sh: add to release-process
    - tricky: currently fails because of invalid database versions, and
        because the pagesize is different on cygwin

o win32: test if prebuilt visual studio-library works in express edition, if 
    it was built with the professional edition (and vice versa)
    -> maybe have to change the build process, if it doesn't work

o win64: need cppunit for hamsterdb-alien

o "pre-mature" support of ACID transactions with only *one* parallel
    transaction
    o make ham_txn_* public (incl. public ham_txn_t *-handle)
        o documentation
        o implementation: only if HAM_HAVE_TRANSACTIONS (or similar)
    o adjust all other functions, which currently have a "reserved" 
        parameter
        o documentation
    o ham_txn_begin: only allow one transaction in parallel, otherwise fail
        o unittests
    o how does abort work if logging is disabled? in this case, we need
        HAM_WRITE_THROUGH in case of commit, and delete the pages in case
        of abort
    o many tests with commit/abort, logging etc

. release-process: enhance automated tests of win32/win64 dll and lib

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper

. new configure switch --force-lsb-compliancy (ohne pread, pwrite)
    o needs support for automated testing!

. scenario: created with log, a few inserts; crash (dbfile is ok,
    but logfile is not empty)
    then opened *without* log, another few inserts, closed
    then opened *with* log, log is not empty -> recovery but logfile
    state is no longer valid! must we store the lsn in the database
    header? or is this a case of PEBCAC?

. new API function ham_set_checkpoint(), or extend ham_flush()
    with new flag HAM_SET_CHECKPOINT??

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

. tests are failing because of a berkeleydb bug:
    --duplicate=1 --use-cursors=1
      o ../../testfiles/1/100.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/202.tst - status mismatch
      o ../../testfiles/1/220.tst - status mismatch
