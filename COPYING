TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DEVELOPER AND ITS 
SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD

8. Concluding provisions 

German law applies to the legal relationship between DEVELOPER and You as 
well as to the respective terms and conditions. Place of jurisdiction for 
both parties is - in so far as permitted by law - Munich (Germany). If You 
are a consumer and are not resident in the European Union, Munich is also 
the place of jurisdiction. In dealings with consumers in the European Union, 
the law at the residence of the end user may also apply if mandatory provisions 
under consumer law are concerned. 

You have no right of offset unless the claim is not in dispute or has been 
determined with legal effect by a court of law. If You are a businessman 
within the meaning of the Commercial Code or a body under public law, then 
the place of fulfilment for deliveries and payments and the place of 
jurisdiction are Munich.

9. Severability

If any part of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable 
under any applicable statute or rule of law, the unenforceable part shall be 
given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remainder will remain 
in full force and effect.

list of customers and in its public communications.

11. Confidentiality

The SOURCE of the PRODUCT will be used solely for the Business Purpose
and for no other purpose whatsoever. You agree to keep it confidential and
to protect its confidentiality with the same degree of care with which You
protect the confidentiality of Your own source codes, but in no event with
less than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to restrict the distribution
of the SOURCE as much as possible, and You further agree to make your
developers, employees, contractors and other persons working with the SOURCE
aware of its confidential nature.
