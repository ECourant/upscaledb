Compilation.................................................

    To compile: run 'make'. The make files are in the mk-
    directory. They don't really work and will be overhauled
    and replaced soon.

Testing.....................................................
    
    To test: run 'make' in src/unittests
    There are unit tests and scripts which help testing. The 
    main test module is 'btree_row' - it can insert and erase 
    values from stdin or a file. 
    
    cd src/unittests
    make
    ./test btree_row -
    <reads from stdin>
    
    or:
    
    echo "1 2 3" | ./test btree_row -
    (inserts 1, 2, 3)
    
    or 
    
    echo "1 2 3 -3" | ./test btree_row -
    (inserts 1, 2, 3, then erases 3)
    
    or 
    ./test btree_row <testfile>
    
    Testfiles are in testfile/row/*. To run all testfiles:
    
    ./testbed.py
    
    To stress test with 2000 random values:
    
    ./testbed.py --random 2000
