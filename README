1. About

hamsterdb is a database engine written in ANSI C. It supports a B+Tree index
structure, uses memory mapped I/O (if available), supports fast Cursors and
variable length keys and can create In-Memory Databases.

This release adds a new flag HAM_CACHE_UNLIMITED which uses unlimited
cache, and is therefore nearly as fast as a pure In-Memory Database. 

Also, the unittests now compile with gcc 4.3.x and glibc 2.8. The C++ API
has a new function to assign a key with a template parameter. ./configure
has a new option --enable-system-zlib to link against -lz instead of the
zlib version which is provided with hamsterdb. Finaly, the tutorial has a
a new chapter about Transactions.

2. Changes

New Features
* The flag HAM_CACHE_UNLIMITED uses unlimited cache

Bugfixes
* unittests compile with gcc 4.3.x and glibc 2.8

Other Changes
* new ./configure flag --enable-system-zlib
* the template function for C++ API to set keys

To see a list of all changes, look in the file CHANGELOG.

3. Roadmap

- Add Transaction API to Python, Java and .NET wrapper
- Release the Perl or PHP wrapper

4. Features

- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Supports multiple databases in one file
- Supports record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Supports duplicate keys
- Support for logging and recovery
- Limited support for Transactions
- Very fast database cursors 
- Configurable page size, cache size and index key size
- Portable ANSI-C implementation
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows, Windows CE and on many
    architectures (also embedded and SPARC)
- Endian-independent file format
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
    mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Supports rudimentary live-reorganization by automatically
    merging freelist entries
- Open source and released under the GPL 2.0 or later
- Supports AES encryption and zlib compression
- Wrappers for C++, Python, Java and .NET

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling 

6.1 Linux and Cygwin/Win32

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library, 
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library. 
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run 'samples/db1' or any
other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (i.e. x86)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines (most other
                            architectures)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)
HAM_ENABLE_INTERNAL     enable internal functions (declared in
                            include/ham/hamsterdb_int.h)
HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION build without support for zlib compression
HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION  build without support for AES encryption

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file 'src/os_win32.c',
and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.c'. Vice versa on non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb

Porting hamsterdb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating system dependend
functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined in 'src/os_win32.c' or 
'src/os_posix.c'. 
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'. 
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item 
9) for important macros. 

11. Commercial Licensing

hamsterdb can be licensed on a per-developer basis for closed sourced 
applications. For more details, see
