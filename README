This is the README file of hamsterdb. 

Contents:

1. About

hamsterdb is a fast and small database engine. You can insert, delete or look
up key/data pairs. It supports a B+Tree index structure with variable length 
keys and variable length data records. 

2. Features

- B+Tree with variable length keys
- Configurable page size and cache size
- ANSI-C implementation, should be portable on all platforms, also embedded
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
  mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers for large databases
- Endian-independent (not tested, though)
- Support for in-memory-databases

3. Known Issues/Bugs

- Endian-independence was not (yet) tested
- Iterators and duplicate items not yet supported
- No concurrency, no transactions, no SQL support...
- Only tested on Linux; should compile on most Unices, but definitely not on 
    Microsoft Windows
- Some versions of gcc break the library when compiling with enabled
    optimization (this is reproducable with gcc 3.4.5)

4. Compiling

To compile hamsterdb, you need scons (www.scons.org). hamsterdb does not use
Makefiles.

After unpacking the tarball, run 'scons' in the root directory. Run 'RELEASE=1
scons' to build the non-debug, faster version of the library. The compiled 
libraries are in the '/build'-directory. 

5. Installation

So far, the scons-Skript does not install hamsterdb to /usr/lib or
/usr/local/lib. You will have to install the files manually.

6. Testing

Scons automatically compiles a simple example program in the directory
'/samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run '/samples/simple'.

7. API Documentation

API documentation is not yet built. The header files in '/include/ham' are 
commented, though. The next release will provide a doxygen script to 
generate the documentation from the header files.
