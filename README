1. About

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is a database engine written in C/C++. It is fast,
production-proven and easy to use.

This release re-implemented AES encryption based on OpenSSL and libcrypto. A
few bugs in the build process were fixed (thanks for all the patches!). A new
build option --without-tcmalloc was added.

A new internal function ham_env_get_metrics returns metrics and usage
statistics that are useful for profiling. When closing the database file,
unused space at the end of the file is truncated and the file will shrink.

The client- and server-side implementation of the remote network access has been
rewritten. The server now uses libuv (a component of Node.js), which resulted
in a performance improvement. libcurl is no longer required as a client-side
dependency. Instead of http, a plain tcp connection is now used. To open a
remote environment, use the prefix "ham://" instead of the now obsolete
"http://", i.e. "ham://localhost:12345/env.db".

Unused space at the end of the file is now truncated, and the file size shrinks
when the Environment is closed. (This feature is disabled on Win32 if memory
mapped I/O is used.)

2. Changes

New Features
* An internal function ham_env_get_metrics was added
* Added support for transparent AES encryption
* Truncating file when closing the Environment

Bugfixes
* Several bugs in the build process were fixed

Other Changes
* Client- and server-side implementation of the remote network access has
    been rewritten (use "ham://" instead of "http://" for the url!).

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

hamsterdb will compile out of the box. On Unix, however, remote functionality
will be disabled if libuv and Google protobuf SDKs are not installed. If
you want to include remote functionality, then you have to download the
dependencies from here:
    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
    https://github.com/joyent/libuv
    http://www.boost.org

On Ubuntu, you can install the following packages:
    protobuf-compiler
    libprotobuf-dev
    libboost-dev
    (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see above)

For Windows, precompiled libraries are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb Embedded Storage in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (the default)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage

Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Licensing

hamsterdb Embedded Storage can be licensed on a per-developer basis for
closed source applications. For more details, see
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing and http://hamsterdb.com/store.

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is released under GPL2 or later. There are several
exceptions for other open source licenses (see
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing/exceptions for legal information and a license
list).
