This is the README file of upscaledb.

1. About

upscaledb is a database engine written in C/C++. It is fast, production-proven
and easy to use.

This is the first public release of upscaledb. It's the successor of hamsterdb,
and merges the closed-source features of hamsterdb PRO: various compression
codecs, AES encryption, CRC32 checksums etc. 

The rebranding of hamsterdb to upscaledb came with a few changes, but most of
them can be performed with a simple search/replace. See below for a list.

Visual Studio 2010 is no longer supported.

The file format is not compatible to 2.1.11.

2. Changes

New Features
* All PRO features were merged

Bugfixes
- issue #58 (.NET) - fixed crash in ham_strerror
- Fixing a bug during recovery where modified pages were not recreated
- Make sure that journal is correctly cleared after recovery
- Make sure that errors are not ignored when creating remote cursors
    (thanks, Ciprian Niculescu)

Other Changes
- The namespace prefix HAM_ was changed to UPS_
- The namespace prefix ham_ was changed to ups_
- The remote URL specifier ham:// was changed to ups://
- UPS_ENABLE_RECOVERY/HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY is deprecated; use
    UPS_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS instead
- The function ham_db_get_key_count was renamed to ups_db_count
- The function ham_key_get_approximate_match_type was removed
- The functions ham_is_pro, ham_is_pro_evaluation were removed
- The flag HAM_FIND_NEAR_MATCH was removed
- The flag HAM_FIND_EXACT_MATCH was renamed to UPS_FIND_EQ_MATCH
- The function ups_db_get_error was removed
- Visual Studio 2010 is no longer supported

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap

4. Features

- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Basic schema support for POD types (i.e. uint32, uint64, real32 etc)
- Very fast analytical functions
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Multiple databases in one file
- Record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Duplicate keys
- Logging and recovery
- Unlimited number of parallel Transactions
- Transparent AES encryption
- Transparent CRC32 verification
- Various compression codecs for journal, keys and records using 
    zlib, snappy, lzf
- Compression for uint32 keys
- Partial reading/writing of records
- Network access (remote databases) via TCP/Protocol Buffers
- Very fast bi-directional database cursors
- Configurable page size, cache size, key sizes etc
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows and other architectures
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
    mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Open source and released under APL 2.0 license
- Wrappers for C++, Java, .NET, Erlang, Python, Ada and others

5. Known Issues/Bugs

See https://github.com/cruppstahl/upscaledb/issues.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile upscaledb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ in the "win32" folder
for MSVC 2013.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the upscaledb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual Studio Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/upscaledb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see upscaledb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ups' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the upscaledb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile upscaledb

If you want to compile upscaledb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting upscaledb

Porting upscaledb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ups/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, upscaledb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ups_export linked against the old version.
(ups_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of upscaledb installed). Then use the newest version of
ups_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ups_export
and ups_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ups_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ups_export-2.1.2 for clarity):

    ups_export-2.1.2 input.db | ups_import --stdin output.db
