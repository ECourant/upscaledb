1. About

upscaledb is a database engine written in C/C++. It is fast, production-proven
and easy to use.

This release fixes a few bugs. This is the last stable release before 2.2.0.

The most significant fixes are:

- #47: fixed bad assert in ups_cursor_move; this caused crashes in debug
    mode

- #66: return with error if a database is modified by a committed
	transaction which was not yet flushed to disk; this caused crashes when
    closing an Environment (ups_env_close)

- #64: fixed segfault when recovering a database with a custom
    compare function; deprecated ups_db_set_compare_func, use
    ups_register_compare/UPS_PARAM_CUSTOM_COMPARE_NAME instead.

    Also, the .NET/C# delegate for custom compare functions has been
    changed, the delegate has to perform the marshalling now (see
    unittests for a sample)

- issue #60: files are now truncated after a database was deleted with
    ups_env_erase_db

The file format is not compatible to 2.1.12.

2. Changes

New Features
* none

Bugfixes
* issue #47: fixed bad assert in ups_cursor_move
* issue #55: correctly handling error condition if mmap fails
* issue #60: files are now truncated after a database was deleted with
    ups_env_erase_db (thanks, vevova)
* issue #62: ups_info prints wrong value for "max record size"
* issue #64: fixed segfault when recovering a database with a custom
    compare function; deprecated ups_db_set_compare_func, use
    ups_register_compare/UPS_PARAM_CUSTOM_COMPARE_NAME instead
* issue #66: return with error if a database is modified by a committed
	transaction which was not yet flushed to disk (thanks, Balazs Bamer) 
* issue #67: fixed broken installation path and other "ham"/"hamsterdb"
	references (thanks, Wouter Hager)

Other Changes
* Changed the .NET/C# delegate interface for custom compare functions; the
    delegate has to perform the marshalling now (see unittests for a
    sample)
* Now restoring the "active blob page" after recovery to reduce the
    file size.
* UPS_ENABLE_RECOVERY is now an alias for UPS_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS

4. Known Issues/Bugs

See https://github.com/cruppstahl/upscaledb/issues.

5. Compiling

5.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile upscaledb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

5.2 Microsoft Visual Studio

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ in the "win32" folder
for MSVC 2013.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the upscaledb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual Studio Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

5.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/upscaledb-alien

6. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see upscaledb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

7. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ups' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the upscaledb web page.

8. Porting upscaledb

Porting upscaledb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in '1os/*.h' and defined
in '1os/os_win32.cc' or '1os/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ups/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

9. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, upscaledb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ups_export linked against the old version.
(ups_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of upscaledb installed). Then use the newest version of
ups_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ups_export
and ups_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ups_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ups_export-2.1.2 for clarity):

    ups_export-2.1.2 input.db | ups_import --stdin output.db
