This is the README file of hamsterdb. 

Contents:

1. About

hamsterdb is a fast and small database engine. You can insert, delete or look
up key/data pairs. It supports a B+Tree index structure with variable length 
keys and variable length data records. 

2. Features

- B+Tree with variable length keys
- Configurable page size and cache size
- ANSI-C implementation, should be portable on all platforms, also embedded
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
  mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers for large databases
- Endian-independent (not tested, though)
- Support for in-memory-databases

3. Known Issues/Bugs

- Endian-independence was not (yet) tested
- Iterators and duplicate items not yet supported
- No concurrency, no transactions, no SQL support...
- Some versions of gcc break the library when compiling with enabled
    optimization (this is reproducable with gcc 3.4.5); gcc 4.1.1 works 
    however

4. Compiling

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library, 
build with debugging symbols etc).

5. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles a simple example program in the directory
'/samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run '/samples/simple'.

6. API Documentation

API documentation is not yet available. The header files in '/include/ham' are 
commented, though. The next release will provide a doxygen script to 
generate the documentation from the header files.
